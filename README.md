How to code a neural network from scratch! (Machine Learning with Phil)

Ingredients of a Neural Network:

- Input Data (images unrolled into arrays)
- bias units
- layers and weights
- activation function
- training function
- prediction function
- cost function
- function to compute gradients of weights
- back propagation function


Neural Network Programming Guide

- Whenever possible, aviod explicit for-loops

- Do not use rank 1 arrays
